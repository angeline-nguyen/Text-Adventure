# Text Adventure Game

In 2018-2019, I was in a Web development program that I loved but had to leave due to work demands. One of the assignments for that program was writing some functions to make a text adventure game work.

For extra practice while I am in a new program (sadly, the old one is now defunct), I am coding from scratch a more complicated version of a text adventure game.

The original assignment can be found on my old GitHub: [https://github.com/angeline-n/wats3020-text-adventure](https://github.com/angeline-n/wats3020-text-adventure).
